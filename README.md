# 📈 Stock Market Time Series Analysis with Python

This project performs an in-depth time series analysis and visualization of historical stock data using Python. It is designed for data science and finance beginners who want to explore stock trends, calculate returns, analyze correlations, and visualize data interactively using libraries like Matplotlib and Plotly.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

### 🔹 Task #1: Problem Statement & Overview
- Introduction to the stock market analysis problem.
- Overview of companies analyzed (Apple, Amazon, Google, Tesla, S&P500, etc.).

### 🔹 Task #2: Import Datasets & Libraries
- Mounts Google Drive to load CSV file.
- Imports required Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, SciPy).
- Reads and previews the stock price dataset.

### 🔹 Task #3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checks for nulls and general dataset info.
- Static plotting of raw stock prices using Matplotlib.

### 🔹 Task #4: Interactive Data Visualization
- Plots interactive stock trends using Plotly Express.
- Normalizes prices to compare different stocks' relative performance.

### 🔹 Task #5: Daily Return Calculation (Single Stock)
- Computes daily returns for Amazon (AMZN) stock.

### 🔹 Task #6: Daily Return Calculation (All Stocks)
- Generalized function to calculate daily percentage returns for all stocks.

### 🔹 Task #7: Correlation Analysis
- Computes correlation matrix for daily returns.
- Visualizes correlation with a heatmap.

### 🔹 Task #8: Risk & Volatility Analysis
- Plots histograms of daily returns.
- Uses Plotly's distribution plots to visualize stock return behavior and risk.
